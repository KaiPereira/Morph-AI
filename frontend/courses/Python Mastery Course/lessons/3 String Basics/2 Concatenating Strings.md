# Concatenating Strings

In Python, you can concatenate (combine) strings using the `+` operator. This allows you to join multiple strings together to create a single string.

## Example

```
# Concatenating two strings
first_name = "John"
last_name = "Doe"
full_name = first_name + " " + last_name
print(full_name)  # Output: John Doe
```

# --hints--

Create a variable called "first" and assign it your name.

```
True if isinstance(first, str) else False
```

Create a variable called "middle" and assign it the value of your middle name.

```
True if isinstance(middle, str) else False
```

Create another variable called "last" and assign it the value of your last name.

```
True if isinstance(last, str) else False
```

Create a variable called "full_name" and assign it the value of first_name concatenated with middle and last name. Remember to add a space in between each word using **+ " "**.

```
True if full_name == first + " " + middle + " " + last else False
```

```
# Put your concatenations here
