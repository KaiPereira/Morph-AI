# Python Strings

In Python, a string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotation marks. Strings are used to represent text and are one of the fundamental data types in Python.

## Creating Strings

Strings can be created using single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`"`), or triple quotes (`'''` or `"""`). Here are some examples:

```
# Single quotes
name = 'Alice'

# Double quotes
message = "Hello, World!"

# Triple quotes for multiline strings
paragraph = '''This is a multiline string.
It can span across multiple lines.
'''

# You can also use double quotes
paragraph = """This is a multiline string.
It can span across multiple lines.
"""
```

# --hints--

Create a string called "my_string" and assign it the value of a string.

```
True if isinstance(my_string, str) else False
```

Create a string called "my_multiline_string" and give it the value of a multi-line string.

```
True if isinstance(my_multiline_string, str) else False
```

# Put your strings down here
