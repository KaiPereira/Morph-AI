# Data Types in Python

In Python, there are several built-in data types that you can use to store and manipulate different kinds of values. Let's explore some of the commonly used data types:

## 1. Integer (`int`)

Integers are used to represent whole numbers without any decimal points. They can be positive, negative, or zero.

Example:
```python
# Assigning an integer value to a variable
x = 42
```

## 2. Float (float)

Floats are used to represent numbers with decimal points. They can be positive, negative, or zero.

Example:

```
# Assigning a float value to a variable
pi = 3.14
```

## 3. String (str)

Strings are used to represent text or sequence of characters. They are enclosed in single quotes ('') or double quotes ("").

Example:

```
# Assigning a string value to a variable
name = 'John Doe'
```

## 4. Boolean (bool)

Booleans are used to represent truth values. They can only have two possible values: True or False.

Example:

```
# Assigning a boolean value to a variable
is_student = True
```

## Others

There's a few others, but we're not going to be taking a look at them just yet!

# --hints--

Create a variable called "my_string" and assign it a string value.

```
True if isinstance(my_string, str) else False
```

Create a variable called "my_int" and assign it an int value.

```
True if isinstance(my_int, int) else False
```

Create a variable called "my_float" and assign it a float value.

```
True if isinstance(my_float, float) else False
```

Create a variable called "my_bool" and assign it a boolean value.

```
True if (my_bool == True) or (my_bool == False) else False
```
