# Assigning Multiple Values

In Python, you can assign multiple values to a variable in a single line using a process called "multiple assignment" or "unpacking". 

This technique allows you to assign values to multiple variables simultaneously.

## Example

```
# Assigning multiple values to multiple variables
x, y, z = 1, 2, 3

a, b, c = "John", "Bob", "Doe"
```

# --hints--

Create three variables, first, middle, and last, and assign them the values "Ben", "Mill", and "Smith" respectively.

```
True if first == "Ben" and middle == "Mill" and last == "Smith" else False
```

Create three variables, car, license_plate, and driver, and assign them the values "tesla", "1b73h5", and "Elon Musk" respectively.

```
True if car == "tesla" and license_plate == "1b73h5" and driver == "Elon Musk" else False
```

# --preset--

```
# Put your variables here
```
