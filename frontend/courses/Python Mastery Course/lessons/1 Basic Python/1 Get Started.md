# Getting Started

Python is a powerful and versatile programming language widely used in various domains such as web development, data analysis, machine learning, and more. 

It emphasizes code readability and simplicity, making it an excellent language for beginners and experienced developers alike.

## Key Features of Python

1. **Easy to Learn:** Python has a clean and readable syntax that makes it easy to understand and write code.

2. **High-level Language:** Python abstracts many low-level details, allowing developers to focus on problem-solving rather than complex implementation details.

3. **Interpreted:** Python programs are interpreted rather than compiled, meaning they are executed line by line by the Python interpreter.

4. **Cross-platform:** Python is available for major operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux, allowing you to write code that can run on different platforms.

5. **Large Standard Library:** Python comes with a comprehensive standard library that provides ready-to-use modules and functions for a wide range of tasks.

## Your first print statement

In Python, the `print` statement is used to display information on the screen. It allows you to output text, variables, or any other data you want to visualize.

## Example

```
# Displaying a simple message
print("Hello, world!")
```

# --hints--

Create your first print statement that prints "Hello World!"

```
import re
pattern = r"^print\([\"\|'].+[\"\|']\)"
True if re.findall(pattern, code, re.MULTILINE) else False
```

# This is where you're going to put all of your Python code
