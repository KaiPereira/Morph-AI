# Python Variable Names

In Python, variable names are used to represent values stored in memory. Choosing meaningful and descriptive variable names is important for writing readable and maintainable code.

## Valid Variable Names

- Variable names can contain letters (a-z, A-Z), digits (0-9), and underscores (_).
- Variable names must start with a letter or an underscore.
- Variable names are case-sensitive, meaning `my_variable` and `my_Variable` are different variables.

## Examples of Valid Variable Names

```
# Valid variable names
name = "John"
age = 25
_total = 1000
first_name = "Alice"
```

## Invalid Variable Names

- Variable names cannot start with a digit.
- Variable names cannot contain special characters such as spaces, punctuation marks, or symbols (!, @, #, $, %, etc.).
- Python keywords cannot be used as variable names.

# --hints--

_startingWithUnderscore should be defined and have a value.

```
True if '_startingWithUnderscore' in locals() else False
```

using_underscores should be defined and have a value

```
True if 'using_underscores' in locals() else False
```

camelCase should be defined and have a value

```
True if 'camelCase' in locals() else False
```
