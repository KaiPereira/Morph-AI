# Declaring Python Variables

In Python, variables are used to store data. You can assign values to variables and refer to those values later in your code.

Variables never need to be declared with a specific type like string or boolean unlike some other languages.

## Example

```
# Declaring and assigning a value to a variable
my_variable = 10
```

# --hints--

Name a variable called "name" and assign it a string value.

```
True if 'name' in locals() else False
```

The variable name should have a value of "John".

```
True if name == "John" else False
```

Name a variable called "pi" and assign it an int value.

```
True if 'pi' in locals() else False
```

Assign the variable "pi" a value of 3.14

```
True if pi == 3.14 else False
```
