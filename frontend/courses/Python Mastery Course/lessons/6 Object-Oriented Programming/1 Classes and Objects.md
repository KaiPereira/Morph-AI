# Classes and Objects

Welcome to the lesson on Classes and Objects! In this lesson, we'll explore the fundamentals of object-oriented programming in Python.

## What are Classes and Objects?

Classes are the blueprint or template for creating objects. They define the structure and behavior of objects. Objects, on the other hand, are instances of a class. 

They represent specific entities that possess attributes and behaviors defined by the class.

## Defining a Class

To define a class, we use the class keyword followed by the class name. The class name should start with an uppercase letter (following the Python naming conventions). 

Let's create a simple class called Person:

```
class Person:
    pass
```

## Creating Objects (Instances)

Once we have defined a class, we can create objects or instances of that class. To create an object, we call the class name followed by parentheses. This invokes the class's constructor, called __init__() method, which initializes the object. 

Let's create an instance of the Person class:

```
person = Person()
```

## Class Attributes and Instance Attributes

Classes can have attributes that are shared among all instances of the class. These are called class attributes. Instance attributes, on the other hand, are specific to each instance of the class.

We define attributes within the __init__() method. Let's add some attributes to our Person class:

```
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
```

Here, name and age are instance attributes, and we use the self parameter to refer to the instance itself.

## Methods

Methods are functions defined within a class that can perform specific actions on objects. They can access and modify the attributes of the class. Let's add a method called greet() to our Person class:

```
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def greet(self):
        print(f"Hello, my name is {self.name}!")
```

The greet() method uses the self parameter to access the instance's name attribute.

## Using Objects and Accessing Attributes

Once we have created an object, we can access its attributes using dot notation (object.attribute). 

Let's create a Person object and access its attributes:

```
person = Person("Alice", 25)
print(person.name)  # Output: Alice
print(person.age)   # Output: 25
```

## Calling Methods

We can call the methods defined in a class using dot notation as well. Let's call the greet() method on our person object:

```
person.greet()  # Output: Hello, my name is Alice!
```

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we learned about classes and objects in Python. We covered how to define a class, create objects, define attributes and methods, and access them. Classes and objects are fundamental to object-oriented programming, allowing us to model real-world entities and organize our code effectively.

In the next lesson, we'll dive deeper into inheritance and polymorphism, building upon the concepts we've learned here.
