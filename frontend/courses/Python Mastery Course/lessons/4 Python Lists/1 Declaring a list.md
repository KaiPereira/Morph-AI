# Declaring Lists

In Python, a list is an ordered collection of items. It can store different types of data such as numbers, strings, or even other lists. Lists are mutable, which means you can modify them after they are created.

To declare a list, you can use square brackets `[]` and separate the items with commas. Here's an example:

```python
# Declaring a list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Declaring a list of strings
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']

# Declaring a list with mixed data types
mixed_list = [10, 'hello', True, 3.14]
```

# --hints--

Name a variable called "my_list"

```
True if isinstance(my_list, list) else False
```

"my_list" should contain at least three elements

```
True if len(my_list) >= 3 else False
```

# --preset--

```
# Put your code down here
```
