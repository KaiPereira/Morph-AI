# Adding Elements to an Array

In Python, an array is a data structure that can hold multiple values. You can add elements to an array using various methods. 

First we're going to explore the append() method. This method will add an element to the end of an array.

## Example

```
# Using the append() method to add an element to the end of the array
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]
numbers.append(5)
print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

# --hints--

Add a new fruit to the end of "fruits".

```
True if len(fruits) == 5 else False
```

# --preset--

```
fruits = ["apple", "orange", "pineapple", "blueberry"]
```
