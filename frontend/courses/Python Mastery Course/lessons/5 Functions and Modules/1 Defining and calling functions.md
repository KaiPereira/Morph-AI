# Functions and Modules

In this lesson, we'll explore the basics of defining and calling functions in Python.

## Functions: An Overview

A function is a reusable block of code that performs a specific task. Functions help organize code, promote code reusability, and make it easier to understand and maintain programs.

## Defining a Function

To define a function in Python, you use the def keyword followed by the function name, parentheses (), and a colon :. The function's code block is indented under the function definition.

```
def function_name():
    # Code block for the function
    # ...
```

## Naming Conventions

When naming functions, it's recommended to use lowercase letters and separate words with underscores (snake_case) to improve readability.

## Calling a Function

To call a function, you simply write the function name followed by parentheses ().

```
function_name()
```

## Conclusion

In this lesson, we covered the basics of defining and calling functions in Python. We explored function structure and naming conventions.

Now that you understand the fundamentals, we're going to look at function parameters, return values, default parameters, and variable-length arguments!
