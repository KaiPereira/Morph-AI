# Subtracting Numbers

Subtraction is an arithmetic operation that involves finding the difference between two numbers. 

In Python, you can subtract numbers using the subtraction operator (-).

## Example

```
# Subtracting two numbers
result = 10 - 5
```

# --hints--

Name a variable called "num1" and assign it the value 254.

```
True if num1 == 254 else False
```

Create a variable called "num2" and assign it the value 125

```
True if num2 == 125 else False
```

Store the results of num1 - num2 in a variable called "result"

```
True if result == num1 - num2 else False
```
