# Multiplying Values

In Python, you can multiply values using the `*` operator. The `*` operator performs multiplication between two operands and returns their product.

## Example

```
# Multiplying two numbers
num1, num2 = 3, 4

result = num1 * num2
```

In the example above, result will be assigned the value 12, which is the product of num1 and num2.

# --hints--

Define a variable called "num1" and assign it the value of 28

```
True if num1 == 28 else False
```

Define a variable called "num2" and assign it the value of 52

```
True if num2 == 52 else False
```

Define another variable called "num3" and assign it the value 43

```
True if num3 == 43 else False
```

Store the result of num1, num2 and num3 in a variable called "result"

```
True if result == num1 * num2 * num3 else False
```
