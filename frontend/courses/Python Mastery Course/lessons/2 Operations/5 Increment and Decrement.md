# Incrementing and Decrementing Variables

In programming, you often need to increase or decrease the value of a variable. This can be done using the increment and decrement operations.

## Incrementing

To increment a variable means to increase its value by a certain amount. In Python, you can use the `+=` operator to perform an increment operation.

Example:
```
x = 5
x += 1
print(x)  # Output: 6
```

## Decrementing

To decrement a variable means to decrease its value by a certain amount. In Python, you can use the -= operator to perform a decrement operation.

Example:

```
y = 10
y -= 3
print(y)  # Output: 7
```

# --hints--

Name a variable "increment" and set it's inital value to 0.

```
True if "increment" in locals() else False
```

Increment the value of "increment" by 1.

```
True if increment == 1 else False
```

Name a variable "decrement" and set it's initial value to 10.

```
True if "decrement" in locals() else False
```

Decrement the value of "decrement" by 1.

```
True if decrement == 9 else False
```
