# Floats in Python

In Python, a float is a numeric data type that represents decimal numbers. Floats are used when more precision is required compared to integers.

## Example

```
# Assigning a float value to a variable
x = 15.875
y = 81.252
```

## Operations

Floats can be used for normal operations like addition, division, etc.

# --hints--

Name a variable called "num1" and assign it the value 28.17

```
True if num1 == 28.17 else False
```

Name a variable called "num2" and assign it the value of 32.5

```
True if num2 == 32.5 else False
```

Create a variable "result" and assign it the value of num1 and num2 multiplied.

```
True if result == num1 * num2 else False
```
