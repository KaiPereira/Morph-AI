# Exponents

In mathematics, an exponent represents repeated multiplication of a base number. It is denoted by raising the base number to a certain power.

For example, in the expression 2^3, the base number is 2 and the exponent is 3. This means that we multiply 2 by itself three times: 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.

## How we do it in Python

In Python, we use the "**" operator for exponents.

For example:

```
# Exponents in Python
num1, num2 = 3, 3

results = num1 ** num2 # 3 to the power of 3 = 27
```

# --hints--

Create a variable called "exponent_1" and assign it the value of 5^2

```
True if exponent_1 == 5 ** 2 else False
```

Create a variable called "exponent_2" and assign it the value of 10^3

```
True if exponent_2 == 10 ** 3 else False
```

Create a variable called "exponent_3" and assign it the value of 25^18

```
True if exponent_3 == 25 ** 18 else False
```
