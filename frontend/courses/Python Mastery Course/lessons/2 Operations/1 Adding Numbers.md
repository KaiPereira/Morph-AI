# Adding Numbers

In Python, you can add numbers using the addition operator (+). Let's practice adding some numbers together.

## Example

Here's an example of adding the numbers 5 and 3

```
# Adding two numbers
x = 5
y = 3
result = x + y
print(result)  # Output: 8
```

# --hints--

Make a variable called "num1" and assign it the value of 23

```
True if num1 == 23 else False
```

Make a variable called "num2" and assign it the value 48

```
True if num2 == 48 else False
```

Store the result of the 2 numbers in a variable called "result"

```
True if result == num1 + num2 else False
```
