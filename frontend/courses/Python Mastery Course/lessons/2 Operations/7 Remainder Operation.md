# The Remainder Operator

The remainder operator, denoted by the percent sign (%), is used to find the remainder of the division between two numbers. 

**It returns the remainder after dividing one number by another.**

## Example

```
# Finding the remainder
remainder = 10 % 3
print(remainder)  # Output: 1
```

In the example above, the remainder operator is used to find the remainder when 10 is divided by 3. The result is 1.

# --hints--

Name a variable called remainder_variable.

```
True if 'remainder_variable' in locals() else False
```

remainder_variable should store the remainder of dividing 15 by 4

```
True if remainder_variable == 15 % 4 else False
```
