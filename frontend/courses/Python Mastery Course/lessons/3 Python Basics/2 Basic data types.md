# Basic Data Types

In this lesson, we'll cover the basic data types in Python. We'll learn about strings, numbers, and boolean values, and how to work with them.

## Strings

A string is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes. Strings can be created using single quotes ('...') or double quotes ("...").

```
# Examples of strings
string1 = 'Hello, World!'
string2 = "Python is fun"
```

You can also use triple quotes to create multi-line strings:

```
# Example of a multi-line string
string3 = """This is a 
multi-line string"""
```

## Numbers

Python supports three types of numerical values: integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers.

### Integers

Integers are whole numbers without a decimal point. You can assign an integer to a variable by simply writing the number.

```
# Example of an integer
number1 = 42
```

### Floating-Point Numbers

Floating-point numbers are numbers with a decimal point. You can assign a floating-point number to a variable by writing the number with a decimal point.

```
# Example of a floating-point number
number2 = 3.14159
```

### Complex Numbers

Complex numbers consist of a real part and an imaginary part. You can assign a complex number to a variable using the complex() function.

## Lists

A list is a collection of values that are ordered and changeable. Lists are created using square brackets [...].

```
# Example of a list
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

You can also create a list with mixed data types:

```
# Example of a list with mixed data types
my_list = ['apple', 2, 3.14, True]
```

## Tuples

A tuple is a collection of values that are ordered and unchangeable. Tuples are created using parentheses (...).

```
# Example of a tuple
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
```

You can also create a tuple with mixed data types:

```
# Example of a tuple with mixed data types
my_tuple = ('apple', 2, 3.14, True)
```

## Dictionaries

A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs. Each key in a dictionary maps to a value. You can use a dictionary to store information that can be looked up using a key.

You can create a dictionary in Python by enclosing a comma-separated list of key-value pairs in curly braces ({}). Each key-value pair is separated by a colon (:), with the key on the left and the value on the right.

```
# Example of creating a dictionary
person = {'name': 'John', 'age': 30, 'city': 'New York'}
```

In the example above, the keys are 'name', 'age', and 'city', and their corresponding values are 'John', 30, and 'New York'.

## Boolean

In Python, the boolean data type is used to represent truth values. The two possible boolean values are True and False.

Here's how you can declare a Boolean:

```
# Example of creating a boolean
boolean = True
```

## Conclusion

Now that you've learned all about different data types we'll check out variables!

You'll learn more about manipulating these data types in future lessons!
