# Basic Arithmetic Operations

In this lesson, we'll cover the basic arithmetic operations that can be performed in Python.

## The different operations

Here's the different arithmetic operations you can perform:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Modulo

Now we'll take a look at each one!

## Addition

Addition is done using the + operator. For example:

```
print(2 + 2)
```

This will output 4.

## Subtraction

Subtraction is done using the - operator. For example:

```
print(5 - 2)
```

This will output 3.

## Multiplication

Multiplication is done using the * operator. For example:

```
print(3 * 4)
```

This will output 12.

## Division

Division is done using the / operator. For example:

```
print(10 / 2)
```

This will output 5.0. Note that the result is a float, even though both operands are integers. 

If you want to get an integer result, you can use the // operator:

```
print(10 // 2)
```

This will output 5.

## Modulo

Modulo is done using the % operator. It returns the remainder after division. For example:

```
print(7 % 3)
```

This will output 1, because 7 divided by 3 leaves a remainder of 1.

## Order of Operations

Just like in mathematics, the order of operations matters in Python. The order of operations is:

- Parentheses
- Exponents
- Multiplication and division (performed left to right)
- Addition and subtraction (performed left to right)

For example:

```
10 + 5 * 2
```

This will output 20, not 30. Multiplication is done first, then addition.

If you want to change the order of operations, you can use parentheses. For example:

```
(10 + 5) * 2
```

## Conclusion

This will output 30, because the addition is done first, then the multiplication.

That's it for basic arithmetic operations! Now that you know how to perform them in Python, you can use them in your programs to do all kinds of calculations.

There are more arithmetic operations but these are the basic ones you need to know!
