# Introduction

Python is a popular high-level programming language that is easy to learn and use. In this lesson, we'll cover the basics of writing and running your first Python program.

## Setting up the environment

Before we begin writing code, we need to set up our Python environment. To do this, follow these steps:

1. Open up VSCode.

2. Create a new file called app and save it with a .py extension. This is the file extension for Python code.

```
app.py
```

3. Enable auto save:

```
file -> Auto Save
```

## Writing your first program

Now that we have our environment set up, we can start writing our first Python program. In Python, the traditional "Hello, World!" program is simple and looks like this:

```
print("Hello, World!")
```

Now, you can run it from the command line by navigating to the directory where the file is saved and running the following command:

```
python app.py
```

## Comments

Comments are a way to add notes and explanations to your code without affecting the program's functionality. In Python, you can add comments by using the # symbol. Anything after the # symbol on a line is treated as a comment and ignored by the Python interpreter. Here's an example:

```
# This is a comment
print("Hello, World!")  # This is another comment
```

## Conclusion

In this lesson, you learned how to set up your Python environment, write and run a simple Python program, and add comments to your code. Congratulations on writing your first Python program!
