# Installing Python

Python is a popular programming language that is widely used for various purposes, such as web development, data science, machine learning, and more. In this lesson, we'll walk you through the process of installing Python on your computer.

## Already Installed?

Before you start the installation process, it's a good idea to check if Python is already installed on your computer. To do this, open your command prompt (Windows) or terminal (Mac/Linux) and type the following command:

```
python --version
```

If Python is installed, you will see the version number. If not, you'll get an error message.

## Download Python

If Python is not installed on your computer, you can download it from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads)

Make sure to download the latest stable version of Python for your operating system. The website will detect your operating system and provide you with the appropriate download link.

## Install Python

Once the download is complete, open the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to install Python on your computer. **Make sure to select the option to add Python to your PATH environment variable**, which will allow you to use Python from the command line.

## Verify the installation

After the installation is complete, open your command prompt or terminal again and type the following command:

```
python --version
```

You should see the version number of the Python installation you just installed. This means that Python is now installed and ready to use on your computer.

## Conclusion

That's it! You've now successfully installed Python on your computer. In the next lesson, we'll set up a code editor to easily run Python Code!
