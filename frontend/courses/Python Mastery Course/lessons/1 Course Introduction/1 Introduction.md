# Multiple linear regression

In the casino game Blackjack, a player can determine whether they have an advantage on the next hand over the house by keeping track of the relative number of high and low cards remaining in the deck. This is called Card Counting.

Having more high cards remaining in the deck favors the player. Each card is assigned a value according to the table below. When the count is positive, the player should bet high. When the count is zero or negative, the player should bet low.

## Example

```
function fnSearch() { 
    var frm = document.searchFrm; 
    var str = encryptData(frm, _currentPage); 
}
```

# --hints--

Name a variable called hello_world_variable

```
True if hello_world_variable == "hello world" else False
```

hello_world_variable should have a value of "hello world"

```
True if hello_world_variable == "hello world" else False
```
