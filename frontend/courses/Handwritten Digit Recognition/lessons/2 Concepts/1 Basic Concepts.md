# Introduction

Welcome to the first lesson of our course on Handwritten Digit Recognition! 

In this lesson, we will introduce the fundamental concepts of deep learning and neural networks, which form the foundation for building powerful machine learning models for image recognition tasks. 

Let's get started!

## What is Deep Learning

Here are some different aspects of deep learning:

- Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on training artificial neural networks to perform tasks such as image and speech recognition.

- Deep learning models are designed to automatically learn relevant features and representations from large amounts of data, without relying on explicit feature engineering.

- Deep learning has revolutionized various fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, speech recognition, and many others.

## Understanding Neural Networks

Here's how Neural Networks actually work:

- Neural networks are computational models inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain.

- A neural network consists of interconnected layers of artificial neurons, or nodes, organized in input, hidden, and output layers.

- Each neuron in a neural network receives inputs, applies an activation function, and produces an output that is passed to the next layer.

- Neural networks are trained using labeled data, where the network adjusts its parameters through a process called backpropagation to minimize the error between predicted and actual outputs.

## Layers

Layers are what a neural network comprises of:

- Input Layer: The input layer receives the raw data, such as pixels of an image or words in a sentence, and passes it to the next layer for processing.

- Hidden Layers: Hidden layers are responsible for learning relevant features and representations from the input data. Deep neural networks typically have multiple hidden layers.

- Output Layer: The output layer produces the final predictions or outputs of the neural network, such as class labels for image recognition or predicted values for regression tasks.
