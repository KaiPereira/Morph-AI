# Introduction

Congratulations! 

You've learned the fundamentals of Handwritten Digit Recognition and have gained insights into deep learning techniques and best practices. 

Now, it's time to put your knowledge into action and apply what you've learned by building a Fashion Model.

## Challenge

Your challenge is to build a deep learning model that can classify images of fashion items into different categories, such as shirts, pants, shoes, and more. 

You'll need to apply the concepts and techniques you've learned throughout the course, including data preprocessing, model architecture design, and model evaluation.

You can access the dataset here: https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/fashion_mnist

The fashion dataset results won't just appear as what it is, they appear as numbers so don't worry if your model is strange:

## Steps

1. Dataset: Choose a suitable dataset for fashion classification. You can use popular datasets like Fashion MNIST, Zalando's Fashion-MNIST, or create your own dataset.

2. Preprocessing: Apply appropriate preprocessing techniques to prepare the data for training, including image resizing, normalization, and augmentation.

3. Model Architecture: Design and implement a deep learning model for fashion classification. Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

4. Training and Evaluation: Train your model on the dataset and evaluate its performance using appropriate evaluation metrics. Analyze the results and fine-tune your model as needed.
