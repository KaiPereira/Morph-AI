# Introduction

In the previous steps, we learned how to load and preprocess the MNIST dataset, build the neural network architecture, and train the model. 

Now, we will compile the model by specifying the loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metric for training. 

This step is crucial in preparing the model for training and setting up the parameters that will be used during the optimization process.

## Importance of Compiling

Compiling the model is a critical step in the deep learning workflow. 

During the compilation process, we configure the model to be trained by specifying important parameters such as the loss function, optimizer, and evaluation metric. 

These parameters play a key role in determining how the model will learn from the training data and optimize its weights to make accurate predictions.

## The compiler code

Here is the code for the compiler:

```
# Compile the model with loss function
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```


## Explanation

### Loss Function

The loss function, also known as the objective function or the cost function, measures the difference between the predicted output and the actual target output. 

```
loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy'
```

It quantifies the error or the discrepancy between the predicted values and the ground truth. 

During training, the goal of the model is to minimize the value of the loss function.

### Optimizer

The optimizer is responsible for updating the weights of the neural network during training to minimize the loss function. 

```
optimizer='adam'
```

It determines how the model will adjust its parameters in order to improve its predictions. 

There are various optimization algorithms available, such as Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), Adam, and RMSprop, among others.

### Evaluation

The evaluation metric is used to measure the performance of the model during training and evaluation. 

```
metrics=['accuracy']
```

It provides additional information on how well the model is performing apart from the loss function. 

Common evaluation metrics for classification problems include accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


## Conclusion

Now you've compiled your code!

Your code should look something like this:

```
import tensorflow as tf

# Load the MNIST dataset
mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()

# Normalize pixel values to [0, 1]
x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0

# Flatten the images
x_train = x_train.reshape((-1, 784))
x_test = x_test.reshape((-1, 784))

# Define the neural network architecture
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_dim=784),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model with loss function
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])
```
