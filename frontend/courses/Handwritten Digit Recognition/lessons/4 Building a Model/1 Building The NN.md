# Introduction

In this step, we will build the neural network architecture for our handwritten digit recognizer using TensorFlow. 

A neural network is a powerful tool for solving complex machine learning problems, such as image recognition. 

We will design a basic feedforward neural network with a single hidden layer for our digit recognition task.

## Building the Neural Network

### The Model

Now, we will define our feedforward neural network architecture. 

For this basic implementation, we will use a single hidden layer with 128 units and a ReLU activation function.

```
# Define the neural network architecture
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_dim=784),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```

### Explanation

In a neural network, the architecture refers to the arrangement and configuration of its layers and units. 

The architecture determines how the network processes input data and generates output predictions. 

For our handwritten digit recognition task, we will be using a feedforward neural network, also known as a multilayer perceptron (MLP), which consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.

- Hidden Layer: The hidden layer is the layer in between the input layer and the output layer. It is responsible for extracting relevant features from the input data. The number of units in the hidden layer determines the capacity of the neural network to capture complex patterns in the data. Too few units may result in underfitting, while too many units may result in overfitting. In our case, we have chosen to use 128 units in the hidden layer.

- Activation Function: An activation function introduces non-linearity into the neural network, allowing it to learn complex, non-linear relationships in the data. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is one of the most commonly used activation functions in neural networks. It computes the output as the maximum of 0 and the input. ReLU is computationally efficient and helps to mitigate the vanishing gradient problem, which can occur in deep neural networks during training.

- Dense Layer: The Dense layer is a fully connected layer in which all the neurons are connected to every neuron in the adjacent layers. It is the most common type of layer used in feedforward neural networks. The Dense layer takes an input and applies a linear transformation followed by an activation function to produce the output.

## Conclusion

Now you've built your model.

Next we're going to compile the model to configure it for training.

Your current code should look something like:

```
import tensorflow as tf

# Load the MNIST dataset
mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()

# Normalize pixel values to [0, 1]
x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0

# Flatten the images
x_train = x_train.reshape((-1, 784))
x_test = x_test.reshape((-1, 784))

# Define the neural network architecture
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_dim=784),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])
```
