# Introduction

In the previous steps, we learned how to implement a basic feedforward neural network for handwritten digit recognition using TensorFlow. 

Now, we will evaluate the performance of our trained model on the test data to assess its accuracy and make sure it's performing well.

## Evalutation

After training our model, it's important to evaluate its performance on the test data to ensure that it's able to generalize well to unseen data. 

This step involves measuring the model's accuracy and loss on the test dataset.

```
# Evaluate the model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print("Test Loss:", loss)
print("Test Accuracy:", accuracy)
```

## Explanation

- The evaluate method in TensorFlow takes in the test data (x_test) and corresponding true labels (y_test) as input and computes the loss and accuracy of the model on this test data.

- The computed loss value represents the discrepancy between the predicted and true labels, with lower values indicating better performance.

- The computed accuracy value represents the proportion of correctly classified samples out of the total samples in the test dataset, with higher values indicating better performance.

## Interpretation

- The test loss and accuracy values provide insights into how well our trained model is performing on unseen data.

- A low test loss and high test accuracy indicate that the model is generalizing well and making accurate predictions on new, unseen images.

- However, if the test loss is high and the test accuracy is low, it may indicate that the model is overfitting, i.e., it's not able to generalize well to unseen data and may need further optimization.

## Actions from interpretation

- If the model has a high test accuracy and low test loss, we can conclude that our model is performing well and can be used for handwritten digit recognition tasks.

- If the model has a low test accuracy and high test loss, we may need to further optimize our model by adjusting hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, or adding more layers to the neural network.

- If the model is overfitting, we may need to apply regularization techniques such as dropout or L1/L2 regularization to prevent overfitting and improve model performance on unseen data.

- We can also try different evaluation metrics or visualization techniques to gain further insights into the model's performance and identify areas for improvement.

## Conclusion

By analyzing the test loss and accuracy values, we can assess the model's performance and take appropriate actions to optimize its performance for handwritten digit recognition tasks.

Next up we're going to load our predictions to see how we actually did!

Your code should look something like this now:

```
import tensorflow as tf

# Load the MNIST dataset
mnist = tf.keras.datasets.mnist
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = mnist.load_data()

# Normalize pixel values to [0, 1]
x_train, x_test = x_train / 255.0, x_test / 255.0

# Flatten the images
x_train = x_train.reshape((-1, 784))
x_test = x_test.reshape((-1, 784))

# Define the neural network architecture
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu', input_dim=784),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model with loss function
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)

# Evaluate the model
loss, accuracy = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print("Test Loss:", loss)
print("Test Accuracy:", accuracy)
```
