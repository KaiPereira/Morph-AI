# Introduction

Now that you've built your first model, it's time for you to build completely by yourself. 

Use the code you already have made during this challenge to build your own model!!

## Data

The dataset for this next challenge will be accessible [here](https://res.cloudinary.com/dtgjeknbw/raw/upload/v1681306347/Morph%20AI/housing_ryvp6b.csv).

## Challenge
