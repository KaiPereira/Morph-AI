# Introduction

In this lesson, you will learn about the **first** step in machine learning, which is data preparation. 

You will understand why data preparation is **important** and learn some simple techniques to prepare data for machine learning models.

## What is it

Data preparation is the process of getting data ready for analysis or modeling. 

It involves cleaning, transforming, and organizing data to ensure that it is in a suitable format for machine learning algorithms to learn from.

## Why it's important

Data preparation is a critical step in machine learning because the quality of the data you use directly **impacts** the accuracy and effectiveness of your machine learning models. 

If the data is not prepared properly, it can lead to *inaccurate* or *biased* results, and the models may not perform well.

## Techniques

1. Cleaning Data: Cleaning data involves removing or correcting any errors, inconsistencies, or missing values in the data. For example, if you have a dataset of students' ages and there are some missing values, you may need to fill in the missing values with appropriate values or remove the rows with missing data.

2. Transforming Data: Transforming data involves converting data into a suitable format for machine learning algorithms to learn from. This can include scaling numerical values to a similar range, converting categorical variables into numerical representations, or encoding text data into numerical vectors. For example, if you have a dataset with heights in inches, you may need to convert them to centimeters to ensure that the data is consistent.

3. Organizing Data: Organizing data involves structuring and rearranging the data so that it is easy to understand and analyze. This can include renaming columns, reordering columns, or splitting data into train and test sets for model evaluation. For example, if you have a dataset with information about cars, you may need to rename columns like "mpg" to "fuel_efficiency" to make it more understandable.
