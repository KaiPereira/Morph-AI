# Hello World!

This course will provide an **in-depth** understanding of linear regression, which is one of the fundamental techniques used in machine learning for predicting numerical values. 

The course will cover the theoretical concepts behind linear regression and provide **hands-on** experience in implementing linear regression models using Sklearn, a popular Python library for machine learning.

## What you'll learn

Some concepts you'll learn doing this project include:
- Concepts of Linear Regression
- Data Preparation
- Building Models
- Evaluating Models
- And more!

## Prerequisites

You don't need any previous knowledge to begin this projects. 

It is **recommended** that you have a little bit of experience in Python but it's really not needed!
