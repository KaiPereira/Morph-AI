# What it is

Linear regression is a **widely** used technique in machine learning for predicting numerical values based on input features. 

It is a simple but **powerful** method that can be used for a wide range of applications, such as:

- Predicting house prices
- Predicintg stock prices
- Predicting sales volumes 
- And so much more!

In this lesson, we will cover the fundamental concepts behind linear regression and understand how it works.

## How it works

Linear regression works by finding the best-fit line that represents the relationship between the inputs based on large quanities of data
