# Introduction

Deep learning has revolutionized the field of image classification, allowing machines to accurately classify images into different categories with high precision. 

Central to the success of deep learning models are the loss functions, which are used to quantify the difference between the predicted outputs and the ground truth labels. 

In this lesson, we will explore the concept of loss functions and their role in image classification using TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework.

## What are loss functions

Loss functions are mathematical functions that measure the dissimilarity between the predicted outputs and the actual ground truth labels during the training process of a deep learning model. 

The goal of training a deep learning model is to minimize the value of the loss function, as a lower loss value indicates that the predicted outputs are closer to the true labels.

## Why loss functions are important

Loss functions play a crucial role in training deep learning models for image classification in TensorFlow. 

They serve as a guide for the optimization algorithm to adjust the model's parameters during training to minimize the error between predicted outputs and ground truth labels. 

The choice of an appropriate loss function can significantly impact the model's performance, and it is essential to choose a loss function that aligns with the specific requirements of the image classification task.

## A few types

- Binary Cross-Entropy Loss: Binary cross-entropy loss is used for binary classification problems, where there are only two classes to predict. It calculates the dissimilarity between the predicted probability of the positive class and the true label of the positive class. Like cross-entropy loss, it is commonly used with sigmoid activation in the output layer of the model.

- Mean Squared Error (MSE) Loss: Mean squared error (MSE) loss measures the average squared difference between the predicted outputs and the true labels. It is commonly used for regression problems where the goal is to predict continuous values. MSE loss penalizes large prediction errors more heavily compared to cross-entropy loss, making it suitable for tasks where small errors are acceptable.

- Categorical Hinge Loss: Categorical hinge loss is used for multi-class classification problems, where it encourages the model to produce higher scores for the correct class and lower scores for the incorrect classes. It is suitable for cases where the classes are mutually exclusive, and only one class can be predicted at a time.
