# Introduction

Here's a challenge lesson that you can use to test your understanding of the flower image classification model we built using TensorFlow and Keras.

In this challenge, you will create a model to detect if a cell is parasitized with malaria or not.

## The datatset

The dataset you'll be using is the [tensorflow malaria dataset](https://www.tensorflow.org/datasets/catalog/malaria).

We're going to be using the [zip file](https://data.lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/public/Malaria/cell_images.zip) for this instead though.

## Need help?
