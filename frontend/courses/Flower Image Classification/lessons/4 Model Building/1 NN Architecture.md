# Introduction

In this lesson, we will learn how to build a simple neural network architecture using Keras for flower image classification. 

We will define the architecture of the neural network, compile it with appropriate settings, and train it on the preprocessed flower image dataset.

## Building the architecture

### Code

Here our model architecture:

```
# Define the neural network architecture
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    # Preprocessing layers
    resize_and_rescale,
    data_augmentation,
    
    # Flatten the input
    layers.Flatten(),
    
    # Hidden layers
    layers.Dense(256, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    
    # Output layer
    layers.Dense(5, activation='softmax')
])
```

### Explanation

1. **Preprocessing layers**: These are the layers that preprocess the input images before they are fed into the neural network. In this code, we have two preprocessing layers - resize_and_rescale and data_augmentation. resize_and_rescale resizes and rescales the input images, while data_augmentation applies data augmentation techniques to increase the diversity of the training dataset. Data augmentation is like adding different flavors to the dataset, so that the model can learn to recognize images in different variations.

2. **Flatten the input**: This layer flattens the input images into a 1-dimensional array, so that they can be fed into the fully connected layers. Think of it like arranging all the pixels of the image in a line, so that the neural network can understand and process them easily.

3. **Hidden layers**: These are the layers that perform the actual computation and learning in the neural network. In this code, we have two hidden layers - layers.Dense(256, activation='relu') and layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'). These are fully connected layers with 256 and 128 units respectively, and they use the ReLU activation function. ReLU stands for Rectified Linear Unit, and it helps the neural network to learn non-linear patterns in the data.

4. **Dropout layers**: These layers help to prevent overfitting in the model, which is when the model becomes too specialized to the training data and does not perform well on unseen data. In this code, we have two dropout layers - layers.Dropout(0.2) after each hidden layer. The number 0.2 represents the fraction of randomly selected neurons that are dropped out during training. Dropout is like randomly switching off some of the neurons in the neural network during training, so that the model learns to be more robust and generalizes better to unseen data.

5. **Output layer**: This is the last layer in the neural network and it produces the final output of the model. In this code, we have an output layer with 5 units, which represents the number of classes in our dataset. The activation function used in the output layer is softmax, which produces probability values for each class. The class with the highest probability is predicted as the final output class by the model.

## Conclusion

Nice job building your model. Next we'll compile it.

Your code should look something like this now:

```
import pathlib
import tensorflow as tf
from keras import layers

dataset_url = "https://storage.googleapis.com/download.tensorflow.org/example_images/flower_photos.tgz"
archive = tf.keras.utils.get_file(origin=dataset_url, extract=True)
data_dir = pathlib.Path(archive).with_suffix('')

# Define the batch size
batch_size = 32

# Load the dataset
train_dataset = tf.keras.preprocessing.image_dataset_from_directory(
    data_dir,
    validation_split=0.2,
    subset="training",
    seed=42,
    image_size=(256, 256),
    batch_size=batch_size,
    label_mode="int"
)

val_dataset = tf.keras.preprocessing.image_dataset_from_directory(
    data_dir,
    validation_split=0.2,
    subset="validation",
    seed=42,
    image_size=(256, 256),
    batch_size=batch_size,
    label_mode="int"
)

input_shape = (256, 256, 3)

# Define the data resizing and rescaling pipeline
resize_and_rescale = tf.keras.Sequential([
  layers.Resizing(input_shape[0], input_shape[1]),
  layers.Rescaling(1./255)
])

# Data augmentation
data_augmentation = tf.keras.Sequential([
  layers.RandomFlip("horizontal"),
  layers.RandomRotation(0.1),
  layers.RandomZoom(0.1),
  layers.RandomContrast(0.1)
])


# Define the neural network architecture
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    # Preprocessing layers
    resize_and_rescale,
    data_augmentation,
    
    # Flatten the input
    layers.Flatten(),
    
    # Hidden layers
    layers.Dense(256, activation='relu'),
    layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    
    # Output layer
